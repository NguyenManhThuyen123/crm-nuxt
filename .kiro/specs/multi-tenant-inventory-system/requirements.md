# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a multi-tenant inventory management system designed for retail stores. The system supports two primary user roles: Admins who have system-wide access and can manage multiple stores, and Sellers who operate within their assigned store. The system includes product management, barcode scanning for sales, invoice generation, inventory tracking, and comprehensive reporting capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to manage multiple stores (tenants) in the system, so that I can oversee operations across different retail locations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin logs in THEN the system SHALL provide access to all stores in the system
2. WHEN an Admin views the dashboard THEN the system SHALL display data aggregated from all stores
3. WHEN an Admin creates a new store THEN the system SHALL generate a unique tenant ID and store configuration
4. WHEN an Admin assigns a Seller to a store THEN the system SHALL restrict that Seller's access to only their assigned store

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to manage products and their variants across all stores, so that I can maintain consistent inventory data and pricing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin creates a product THEN the system SHALL allow assignment to specific stores (tenants)
2. WHEN an Admin creates product variants THEN the system SHALL require unique barcode, weight, price, and stock quantity for each variant
3. WHEN an Admin updates product information THEN the system SHALL apply changes to the specified store's inventory
4. WHEN an Admin deletes a product THEN the system SHALL remove all associated variants and update related invoices accordingly
5. IF a barcode already exists in the system THEN the system SHALL prevent creation of duplicate barcodes

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Seller, I want to scan product barcodes to quickly add items to customer orders, so that I can process sales efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Seller scans a barcode THEN the system SHALL retrieve the corresponding product variant information
2. WHEN a valid barcode is scanned THEN the system SHALL display product name, weight, price, and available stock
3. WHEN an invalid barcode is scanned THEN the system SHALL display an error message
4. WHEN a Seller adds a scanned item to the cart THEN the system SHALL allow quantity input and calculate line totals
5. IF the requested quantity exceeds available stock THEN the system SHALL prevent the addition and display a stock warning

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a Seller, I want to create invoices for customer purchases, so that I can complete sales transactions and update inventory automatically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Seller submits an invoice THEN the system SHALL create an Invoice record with current timestamp and total amount
2. WHEN an invoice is created THEN the system SHALL generate InvoiceItem records for each cart item
3. WHEN an invoice is processed THEN the system SHALL automatically reduce ProductVariant stock quantities
4. WHEN stock reduction occurs THEN the system SHALL use database transactions to ensure data consistency
5. IF any item in the invoice has insufficient stock THEN the system SHALL reject the entire invoice and display specific error messages

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a Seller, I want to view my sales history, so that I can track my performance and review past transactions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a Seller accesses their invoice history THEN the system SHALL display only invoices created by that Seller
2. WHEN viewing invoice history THEN the system SHALL show invoice date, total amount, and item count
3. WHEN a Seller clicks on an invoice THEN the system SHALL display detailed line items with quantities and prices
4. WHEN filtering invoices by date THEN the system SHALL return results within the specified date range

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an Admin, I want to view comprehensive sales reports and analytics, so that I can make informed business decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an Admin requests sales reports THEN the system SHALL provide data filtered by date range and store
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL calculate total revenue, units sold, and top-selling products
3. WHEN viewing dashboard analytics THEN the system SHALL display charts for revenue trends, inventory levels, and product performance
4. WHEN exporting reports THEN the system SHALL provide data in standard formats (CSV, PDF)
5. IF no data exists for the selected period THEN the system SHALL display appropriate empty state messages

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system user, I want secure authentication and role-based access control, so that sensitive business data is protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL validate credentials and generate a JWT token with role and tenant information
2. WHEN accessing protected routes THEN the system SHALL verify JWT token validity and role permissions
3. WHEN an Admin accesses admin routes THEN the system SHALL allow access regardless of tenant restrictions
4. WHEN a Seller accesses seller routes THEN the system SHALL filter all data by their assigned tenant ID
5. IF a user attempts unauthorized access THEN the system SHALL return 403 Forbidden status and redirect to login

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to maintain data integrity across all operations, so that inventory and financial data remains accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN concurrent users modify the same product variant THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions using database locks
2. WHEN an invoice is created THEN the system SHALL use database transactions to ensure atomicity
3. WHEN stock levels reach zero THEN the system SHALL prevent further sales of that variant
4. WHEN data validation fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error messages and maintain system state
5. IF system errors occur during transactions THEN the system SHALL rollback all changes and log error details

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a business owner, I want the system to handle multiple stores efficiently, so that performance remains consistent as the business scales.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system serves multiple tenants THEN the system SHALL isolate data between different stores
2. WHEN database queries execute THEN the system SHALL automatically filter results by tenant ID for Seller users
3. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 2 seconds for standard operations
4. WHEN generating reports for large datasets THEN the system SHALL implement pagination and caching strategies
5. IF database connections are exhausted THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide appropriate user feedback

### Requirement 10

**User Story:** As a user, I want a modern and responsive user interface, so that I can efficiently interact with the system on different devices.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system renders UI components THEN the system SHALL use Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design
2. WHEN displaying forms, buttons, and interactive elements THEN the system SHALL use shadcn-vue component library for consistent design
3. WHEN users access the system on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL provide a responsive layout that adapts to screen size
4. WHEN users interact with UI elements THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback and smooth transitions
5. WHEN the system displays data tables and charts THEN the system SHALL ensure proper styling integration with the chosen UI framework
